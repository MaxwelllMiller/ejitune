Hello!

Thanks for downloading and trying EjiTune.  Extract the files into a folder and open ejitune.maxpat with Max.  
After resolving any errors, you should be good to start audio and play!

EjiTune is set up to work with the poly~ patch provided, but the about-ejitune.pdf document details the sort
of input and output you can expect from the js object.  From there it should be relatively easy to adapt
to whatever use-case you have!
